🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A content-based Movie Recommendation System built using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) that recommends similar movies based on user-selected input.
The system analyzes movie metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew to find similarity between movies.


📌 Project Overview

This project recommends movies by calculating cosine similarity between movie vectors generated from textual features. 
The application provides an interactive web interface using Streamlit, allowing users to select a movie and receive recommended movies instantly.


🚀 Features

- Content-based movie recommendations
- Similarity computation using cosine similarity
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit
- Efficient preprocessing using pickle files
- Fast recommendations using precomputed similarity matrix
